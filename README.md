What Is Oracle?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oracle is a manga that I am currently working on.

I also want to be a game developer and right now I don't
have the tools to use Unity so I'm purely going to learn programming through this method, I'm using the
baseline as the story for my manga which features 10 elements and I thought it fit with an RPG.
